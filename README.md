Hi!

Here is my solution to the coding challenge. 

As expected, I didn't manage to finish it in 4 hours, so I'm submitting the progress I made up until this point.

I unfortunately did not have time to aniamte the markers or the clock, or to make the design responsive, and some elements are not placed as nicely as I'd like.

What I found most interesting and challenging about this projecy was working with complex SVGs.
The first thing I did was adding the markers manually in a separate Figma file, then exporting the entire map with the markers in place, so I wouldn't have to position them using CSS.
To be able to add event handlers to specific groups, I then decided to turn the entire svg into a React component, so I could easily add OnClick event hanlders and use them to manage the entire component's state.

With these two steps, I solved the issue of clicking on the markers and having the city change. After this all I had to do was add a simple function for calculating the current time in different time zones, and the main functionality was complete.


I wish I had some more time to play around with animations and make the whole thing prettier, but all in all I am satisfied with my work.


Thank you for reviewing it!
